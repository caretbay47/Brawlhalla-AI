So I wasn't sure, but it turns out that template matching will more than likely be my best option for tracking the coords
of the player and the enemy seperately. 

TEMPLATE MATCHING

So this is obviously going to be pretty computationally demanding with that said, the less "processing" that my computer
has to do, the better. 

Question: I am currently unsure if it is better to 'hard code' the coords for the different maps, and then use template matching to
determine what map it is, or if i should use contour detection. (I think the hard code is probably better)

In order to train an AI to play Brawlhalla, i'll need some training data. Now, determining what data the AI 'needs' inorder to play Brawlhalla
is proving more complicated than I originally thought. It's hard to know and pin point exactly what the AI needs as most of this 'data'
is stuff I dont even think about while playing, like how many recovery options I have left, because while in-game I just 'know' without really 
thinking about it.
